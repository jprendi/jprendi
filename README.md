🚀 Hi, I’m Jess and currently a Master's student in Physics at ETHZ.
🌟 During my Master's, I specialized mainly on particle physics but also its applications to medicine. 
🌌 I’m currently learning about the exciting world of anomaly detection for new physics searches at the LHC!
🪐 I'm incredibly curious by nature and love learning new things, especially when it comes to tools that could help us in understanding fundamental physics further.
